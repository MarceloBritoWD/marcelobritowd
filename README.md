## Hi there 👋

🧑🏻‍💻 With over 8 years of experience, I have worked across multiple industries, ranging from digital agencies to enterprise platforms. I currently lead the engineering efforts at Finstein GmbH, a fintech startup headquartered in Germany.

My main technology stack includes Angular, React, Next.js, Node.js, Spring Boot, and Google Cloud. I am continuously exploring new tools and frameworks that can help address real-world challenges more effectively.

I am passionate about developing scalable and maintainable applications. I also enjoy mentoring developers and contributing to products that deliver real value and impact to thousands of users.
